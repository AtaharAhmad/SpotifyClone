# SpotifyClone
I successfully created a web-based music player resembling Spotify, solely using HTML5 and CSS. This project involved structuring the layout, styling the interface, and replicating key features like navigation, playlists, and playback controls. While it lacked functionalities like streaming actual music, it showcased my skills in front-end development and my ability to bring an idea to life with code.
